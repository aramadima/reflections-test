How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is a virtual area that bundles files that are later to be committed to a repository. It offers a temporary intermediate place between the actual working directory and the repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Creating an experiment, or modifying something considerably in the code, trying new things out etc.
