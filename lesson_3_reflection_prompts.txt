When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To be able to sync the data as a backup, share it with colleagues, collaborate with others working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To control the exact time of change, which is better known to you than Git itself.
